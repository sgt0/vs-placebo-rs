# vs-placebo-rs

Abandoned Rust port of [vs-placebo](https://github.com/Lypheo/vs-placebo). Only
Deband has any work done. If I recall correctly, it was working albeit without
dithering. My notes also say there was a segfault after the final frame but I
might have fixed that. While working on dithering, I reinstalled my OS and lost
whatever magic setup I had that enabled the static Windows build to work. I
tried for a long time to get it working again but eventually gave up. The whole
thing is probably not in a functional state at the moment.

I'm publishing this so that the work doesn't rot away on my machine. I would
still like to pick it back up some day but seeing how it has been months since I
last touched it, I'm gonna chalk it up as abandoned for now.
